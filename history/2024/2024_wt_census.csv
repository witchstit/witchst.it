Add permant map points at trail intersections, center camp and gate. I like the idea of a permant board that the map can be nailed or stapled to each year, (think state park map) Could also have a message board too. (AKA snow on Sunday must use transport for packout plan accordingly or party at xyz camp 10pm)

Also, transport in will be nessisary under some weather conditions (snow, ice or mudd), but roads should be built so that drive in can be done, when weather permits. Load/ unload is a lot of extra work and requires extra volunteers. If it can be avoided it should be."
