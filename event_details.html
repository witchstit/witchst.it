    <h2>2024 Event Details</h2>
    We're still a bit green at this and still figuring a lot of it out, but here are some things that we know and you might want to know too:
    <h3>The Basics</h3>
    Witch's Tit is an event that follows the model and cultural ideals set forth by Burning Man out in the Nevada Desert. If you need info about what that entails check out our <a href="survival_guide.html">survival guide</a>.

    <h4>When</h4>
    February 15-18, 2024
    <h4>Where</h4>
    Bruno, MN. The gate is located at <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=46.3022&mlon=-92.5582#map=15/46.3022/-92.5582">46¬∞18'07.9"N 92¬∞33'29.5"W</a> / 46.302194N 92.558194W / <a href="https://w3w.co/autographs.senders.takes">autographs.senders.takes</a>
    <h4>Theme?</h4>
    Dust off your hula skirt, it's gunna be a üå¥ Tropical Luau üå¥
    <h4>Can I help?</h4>
    You sure can! Right now the best way to scope opportunities to get involved is to join our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/witchstit">Facebook Page</a> and see when we're planning work weekends or have other requests out to the community. As we get our shit together more we'll also have a way to signup for volunteer shifts at the event itself.
    <h4>Tickets</h4>
    Go check out our <a href="ticketing.html">Ticket Page</a>.
    <h4>What's the timeline look like?</h4>
      Mid Nov - Ticket sales begin, theme camp submission form released<br />
      Solstice - Theme camp submission due<br />
      Mid Jan/Mid Feb - Early build days on site. It's possible to assemble and leave things on site, so if you have a theme camp and want to build an A-frame / quincy hut / skyscraper / whatever there'll be opportunities to do so<br />
      Mid Feb - üí•
    <div id="gate"><h4>Gate</h4></div>
    Gate will be open 12-7 on Thursday and Friday, OR by appointment. In addition, arrival outside this time may be accommodated. Exact protocol TBD, but the basic plan will be to let the Gate Dept know when you you plan to arrive, get their OK on it, then someone will trudge down to let you in when you arrive. Note that Gate's blessing on this depends on what you plan to arrive - 9:00 PM is more likely to be allowed than 3:30 AM.

    The gate will not be open for arrivals on Saturday and no reentry will be allowed.
    <h4>Parking</h4>
    Parking passes are required to park at the event.<br />

    The trails past the parking lot are too rough to support road vehicles, so gear will have to be unloaded from your car onto one of the All-Terrain-All-Weather-Ferry-Vehicles we have available for transport to your camping location.<br />

    The whole site is too rough for RV travel in the winter, so unfortunately we can't let RVs head in there with snow on the ground. We're working to improve this situation. BUT if you're OK with getting your RV in there before snowfall and leaving it there until spring then we might be able to work something out. Send an email the <a href="mailto:dom@witchst.it">Dept of Movement</a> and maybe we can work something out.
    <div id="theme_camp"></div><h4>Theme Camp Biz</h4></div>
    A theme camp application form will be rolled out alongside ticket sales in mid Nov. Theme camp submissions will close on the solstice at 21:27 CST, Dec 21.<br />

    One thing we're offering theme camps is the opportunity to pre-order firewood, to be waiting in a tarped pile when you arrive. Details TBD, but orders are likely to be ue due at the same time as camp submissions.

    <div id="wood"><h4>Wood</h4></div>
    <b>Do not bring fire wood from outside Pine County.</b> Emerald borer and spongy moth are spreading and we'd like to keep them away. It will be possible to preorder responsibly harvested wood and have it waiting for you in your camp's location. Check back here closer to the event for details on how to do that. Find lots more detail about firewood in the <a href="https://witchst.it/survival_guide.html">Survival Guide</a>.
    <h4>Can I bring my...</h4>
    <b>Kid? </b>We love to see kids at burns, and they're certainly welcome at Witch's Tit! Winter camping in Minnesota can present unexpected challenges (or hell, even just big expected challenges) and we don't want anyone to be stuck here having a sucky time. We highly recommend you have family winter camping experience before bringing a child to this event.<br />

    <b>RV? </b> Maybe, kinda, if you wanna leave it there over winter. See above.<br />

    <b>Propane heater / wood stove / other heat source for enclosed areas</b> Absolutely, but YOU GOTTA bring a carbon monoxide detector if you're using it in your tent or other enclosed area. They're like 15 bucks at the usual online retailer scumbags, just bring one.<br />

    <b>weapons / fireworks / dogs / other things banned at every regional burn</b> ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Be cool, man.<br />
