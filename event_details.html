    <h4>Where</h4>
    Bruno, MN. The gate is located at this location, provided in 3 different geolocation formats for your convenience and/or satisfaction:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=46.3022&mlon=-92.5582#map=15/46.3022/-92.5582">46¬∞18'07.9"N 92¬∞33'29.5"W</a> (DMS notation)</li>

      <li><a href="https://w3w.co/autographs.senders.takes">autographs.senders.takes</a> (What3Words)</li>
    </ul>
    <div id="theme"><h4>Theme?</h4></div>
    Look up to the night sky and <a href="https://forms.gle/p2QHytrhr4NKqCqL8">submit a theme</a> that might get chosen as the 2026 theme. The submission page will be open through 30 Sept 2025.
    <h4>Can I help?</h4>
    You sure can! One of the best ways is to pop over to our <a href="volunteer.html">volunteer page</a> do whatever it says there.<br />

    Another great way would be to adopt the center camp dome and curate it into a space that fits your vision. The <a href="https://forms.gle/tA8SbPH5qNTUcDY79">submission form</a> for that will stay open until 30 Sept 2025 and the adopter will be announced Very Shortly After‚Ñ¢.
    <h4>Tickets</h4>
    Go check out our <a href="ticketing.html">Ticket Page</a>.
    <div id="gate"><h4>Gate</h4></div>
    Gate will be open 12-7 on Thursday and Friday, OR by appointment. In addition, arrival outside this time may be accommodated. Exact protocol TBD, but the basic plan will be to let the Gate Dept know when you you plan to arrive, get their OK on it, then someone will trudge down to let you in when you arrive. Note that Gate's blessing on this depends on what you plan to arrive - 9:00 PM is more likely to be allowed than 3:30 AM.

    The gate will not be open for arrivals on Saturday and no reentry will be allowed.
    <h4>Parking</h4>
    Parking passes are required to park at the event.<br />

    If you were here last year, know that the parking and entry situations have improved greatly since then but it still might not be possible to drive all the way to your site. We'll have a four wheeler to haul you and your stuff where it needs to go if needed. <br />

    The RV situation has also improved in the last year, but it still might make things easier if you brought it up before snow flies and left it there until spring. <a href="mailto:colderthan@witchst.it">Holler at us</a> if you've got an RV pass and we can figure out the best way to make it work.

    <div id="theme_camp"></div><h4>Theme Camp Biz</h4></div>
    The theme camp and art application form isn't yet open for 2026, stay tuned here or the usual info sources to stay informed.

    One thing we're offering everyone is the opportunity to pre-order firewood, to be waiting in a tarped pile when you arrive. We'll email all ticket holders and make posts in all the usual places when wood sales open up.

    <div id="wood"><h4>Wood</h4></div>
    <b>Do not bring fire wood from outside Pine County.</b> Emerald borer and spongy moth are spreading and we'd like to keep them away. We'll have wood up for presale and walkup sales will be open during the event, but for now find lots more detail about firewood in the <a href="https://witchst.it/survival_guide.html">Survival Guide</a>.
    <h4>Can I bring my...</h4>
    <b>Kid? </b>We love to see kids at burns, and they're certainly welcome at Witch's Tit! Winter camping in Minnesota can present unexpected challenges (or hell, even just big expected challenges) and we don't want anyone to be stuck here having a sucky time. We highly recommend you have family winter camping experience before bringing a child to this event.<br />

    <b>RV? </b> Maybe, kinda, if you wanna leave it there over winter. See above.<br />

    <b>Propane heater / wood stove / other heat source for enclosed areas</b> Absolutely, but YOU GOTTA bring a carbon monoxide detector if you're using it in your tent or other enclosed area. They're like 15 bucks at the usual online retailer scumbags, just bring one.<br />

    <b>weapons / fireworks / dogs / other things banned at every regional burn</b> ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Be cool, man.<br />
