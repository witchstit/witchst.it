## Intro
This Survival Guide is here to help you understand what to expect at Witch's Tit, and what you'll need to be ready for a Winter Burn in Minnesota. Note that this guide, while helpful, is far from comprehensive; we encourage you to seek out more information on wilderness survival and especially winter camping. This community values mutual support, but ultimately only you can be responsible for your own health, well-being, and comfort.
Additionally, we expect everyone to follow basic rules pertaining to public safety and communal well-being to help ensure the collective survival of our attendees and the event. That starts with reading this Guide - hooray we're in the right place!
Unless this is your first Burn (and if it is, WOW, we're excited to welcome you home) then you are already familiar with the Ten Principles. The Principles are a list of cultural values that grew out of Burning Man, and you can [read them here](http://www.burningman.com/whatisburningman/about_burningman/principles.html). They are not rules to follow but ideals which guide us. 
## DON'T GET LOST
### Address and Directions
The event entrance is on Park Hills Rd in Bruno, Pine County, MN. The exact location is at [46°18'07.9"N 92°33'29.5"W](https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=46.3022&mlon=-92.5582#map=15/46.3022/-92.5582) / 46.302194N 92.558194W / [autographs.senders.takes](https://w3w.co/autographs.senders.takes)

If you follow the mapquest directions, through Bruno, it will bring you straight here... BUT if you continue on Hwy 23 to Kerrick it will reroute you and it will cut the time down on dirt roads. Via Bruno is about 7.5 miles on gravel, but via Kerrick is only about 2.5.

- Look for the red Gate Headquarters Building (shed) at the entrance.
- Consider carpooling in a 4x4 or all wheel drive vehicle. You will have to navigate several miles of dirt road that is not plowed as often as the highways are, and parking will be limited. 
- See the [Event Details](https://witchst.it/event_details.html#gate) page for gate hours. **The gate will not be open Saturday and no entry accommodations will be made then. No re-entry will be allowed after you leave the event.**
- When you arrive, find the person volunteering at the gate (a small red building at the parking entrance) they will help you check in, show you where you can park, and explain how to shuttle your gear to center camp. 
- We will help you get your gear from the parking area to center camp. From there it is on you. Pack your gear in bins or bags and bring a plastic sled to help move your gear.

## DON'T DIE IN THE SNOW
**When you come to Witch's Tit you must bring everything you need with you.**  
At bare minimum this includes: 
- food and drink
- shelter
- winter clothing, sufficient to -20 °F
- basic first aid supplies

Wait, 20 below? Will it really be that cold? Maybe not, but extreme cold is as common in central Minnesota as extreme heat is in Black Rock City. **Weather will likely be our greatest challenge.** The average overnight low in Pine County, MN in February is 3 °F, and the record low is -21 °F (not including windchill). And we may get several inches of snow!

Camping during the winter necessitates a level of preparation and planning that exceeds the scope of information covered in this Survival Guide. We urge you to do extensive research before attending the event, including reading the referenced documents at the end of this guide, seeking the advice of experienced winter campers or, if possible, obtain certification in Wilderness First Aid. If you have the option it can help to try camping in your backyard on a cold night to experiment with how to stay more comfortable in the cold.
## What's NOT On-site
- RV hookups
- Electricity
- Running water
- Food vendors
- Picnic tables
- Fire rings (You can bring your own)
## Winter Preparedness
- **Dress in layers.** This is Winter 101, regulating your temperature by dressing up and down in stages. Remember that outer layers are easy to take on and off, but inner layers are not. If work makes you too warm but you're still out in the elements, try taking off one glove to regulate. Didn't work? Try both gloves. Still didn't work? Okay now you might want to shed a layer. Try to leave your hat on.
- **Do not plan to sleep in your car.** Parking is near the main road, not very close to the event, and running a car can create exhaust that is a danger to others parked next to you.
- **Do a test run** with your equipment before leaving home.
- **Bring winter driving gear** such as snow tires. A snow shovel, sand (for traction), tow rope with a hook, and other tools can also prove to be very useful if it snows during the event or if your car gets stuck. Better to plan ahead than to pay for towing.
- **Bring a sled** to transport your gear over the snow.
- **Batteries lose charge** in the cold. Small electronic devices can be worn next to your skin to stay warm enough to still function. This includes cell phones, but also key fobs for keyless cars. Can your car sit for several days in extreme cold and still reliably start? Do you have jumper cables?
- **Be prepared to sleep in the cold** no matter what heat source you bring. Do not bet your life on the effectiveness of any device you bring. Also, trying to heat your tent all night is not necessarily your goal. Most heaters recommend you do not use them overnight and getting too warm at night will make you sweat. Relying on localized heat (like a hot water bottle tucked by your feet / crotch) rather than heating your entire tent can be very effective.
- **Cold makes plastic brittle.** Assess your warm-weather camping gear for durability at sub-zero temperatures. In particular, inflatable air mattresses can become brittle and fail in freezing temps.
- **Wood burning stove** with a chimney is an option for some tents. A tent stove is smaller than a fireplace, so you will need to be able to split and cut your firewood into smaller pieces. You will need to add wood every hour or two, so you might want to plan to take turns tending the fire. 
- **Propane or Butane** - Those little heaters that don't need a chimney are great, but have some inherent drawbacks for use in a tent. Namely they create carbon dioxide (CO₂) and a surprising amount of water vapor when the fuel burns. You want good ventilation so the water does not condense on the inside of your tent when it is on. Crucial precautions if you go this route include:
  - The heater must be labeled "indoor-safe."
  - It must have an automatic tip-over shut-off.
  - The heater should have a low-oxygen sensor alarm or shut-off.
  - You should put the heater on a metal tray or other non- flammable surface so you don't melt your tent or start it on fire if the heater tips over. 
  - You should not sleep with the heater on.
  - **You must have an audible carbon monoxide detector**
  - Bring a **fire extinguisher**, too
- **Electric Heat** is not a viable option as there is no electricity at the event. Please do not run a gas generator to produce electric heat.
- Speaking of **generators**, here are a few guidelines if you or your camp bring one:
  - Put your gen away from people. They're loud and emit [potentially deadly](https://www.cpsc.gov/s3fs-public/Fatal-Incidents-Associated-with-Non-Fire-Carbon-Monoxide-Poisioning-from-Engine-Driven-Generators-and-Other-Engine-Driven-Tools-2011-2021.pdf) carbon monoxide.
  - If you're up near Center Camp consider putting your gen right with the ones that'll be powering Center Camp / Rangers / Med. Or if not, consider putting you and your neighbors' gennies in the same place. Consolidating power sites will go a long way to reducing the issues associated with them.
  - Put some walls around the gen to **baffle the sound**. They walls can be plywood, or potentially snow based on the how much accumulation there is. You can share sound mitigation with your neighbor, too.
    - ed. note- in case it's not obvious, leave the top open. A few years ago some folks unintentionally brought fire art to an nearby regional burn when they left their fully enclosed genny running while they left to go shower
  - Bring a **fire extinguisher** in case your generator turns into unintended fire art
- **Hot water bottle** - any bottle can be a hot water bottle if you put hot water in it, but if you are going to put it in your sleeping bag make sure there is no chance of it leaking. 
- **Buddy up.** Share your tent with a friend, it helps more than you think. Both in and out of the tent, a buddy keeping an eye on you can help avert problems before they become disasters. We ask that all Titterers practice a sort of  buddy system - not necessarily conjoined at the hip, but checking in with their buddy every so often
- **Straw** makes a good insulator underneath your tent. There will be bales available to pull from and spread around
- **Hammock Camping (Advanced Maneuver)** - Have an insulated hammock and use an underquilt or insulated sleeping pad. Employ a cold-weather sleeping bag and a top quilt with a tarp or rainfly above your hammock. Dress in layered clothing, including moisture-wicking base layers, insulating layers, and a waterproof outer layer.
## Cooking, Food, and Water
- **Cook stove** for cooking and heating water. Even if you don't plan on cooking, you may need to thaw out your food or warm up some water. 
- **Bowl for propane.** Some cooking stoves use propane or isoPro for fuel, as it evaporates it cools the fuel. Once the fuel gets to about -20 it no longer evaporates. You can solve this by putting the fuel in a small bowl of water. The water will keep the propane relatively warm.
- **Table or cutting board,** something to put your stove on. If the snow is deep you can just use a cutting board on the snow as a table. 
- **Do not skimp on food.** Your body is working hard to keep you warm, and that requires fuel! Comfort foods are especially good, and warm foods such as soups, hot cocoa and tea, will help you stay warm and make you happy. Remember though, the easier it is to make and prepare, the more likely you are to actually make it when you need it! It's possible that your food can freeze if left exposed to the elements (this includes fruit and veggies), so plan ahead and bring food that can be easily thawed.
- **Dense foods stay warm longer** in your bowl as you eat. Soup or mashed potatoes will stay warm longer than spaghetti or green beans.
- **Water left out will freeze solid** and become useless, especially if it is in a plastic jug that can't be heated on a fire or stove.
- **Keeping your food in a cooler** (without ice) can keep your food and water from freezing. If it is really cold you can warm up some of your water on your stove to keep the cooler at refrigerator temps. 
- You can use a **small cooler** with a tap as an insulated water source, so long as you clean it thoroughly first.
- **Protect your food** from critters. You shouldn't need to worry about bears this time of year, but keep your food in containers that mice and other critters can't get into. 

A more complete sample packing list appears at the end of this Guide.

## Cold-Related Health Emergencies
- **Frostnip:** Frostnip is a less severe cold-related condition often preceding frostbite, characterized by numbness and pale skin in the affected area due to prolonged cold exposure. As the skin rewarms, you may experience pain and tingling, but it typically does not result in permanent skin damage.
- **Frostbite:** Frostbite is a serious cold-weather injury that occurs when your skin and underlying tissues freeze, most commonly affecting areas like fingers, toes, nose, and ears. Recognizable symptoms include white or grayish-yellow skin, firm or waxy texture, and numbness. Seek immediate medical attention if you or someone in your group displays these symptoms to prevent further complications.
- **Hypothermia:** Hypothermia is a life-threatening condition that arises when your body loses heat more rapidly than it can generate it, resulting in a dangerously low body temperature below 95°F. Common symptoms of hypothermia to watch out for include shivering, slurred speech, slow and shallow breathing, a weak pulse, clumsiness, drowsiness, confusion, and a loss of consciousness. It's crucial to be vigilant, as the onset of hypothermia may not be readily apparent, and individuals experiencing it may not be aware due to the confusion it can cause. Prompt action is necessary in this cold-weather emergency.
- **Dehydration:** is still a risk in the cold, although for different reasons than summer exercise. Dehydration remains a concern during winter camping due to increased fluid loss from respiratory water loss, reduced thirst sensation, and calorie expenditure for warmth. Look out for signs such as chapped lips, dry skin, cool and blotchy extremities, headaches, and dark-colored urine, as staying adequately hydrated is crucial in colder conditions.
- **Carbon Monoxide Poisoning:** Carbon monoxide is produced by various fuel-burning products, typically posing no concern in well-ventilated areas. However, when used in confined spaces, it can reach dangerous levels, leading to symptoms such as headaches, weakness, dizziness, nausea, shortness of breath, confusion, blurred vision, drowsiness, loss of muscle control, and loss of consciousness..

## DON'T GET KICKED OUT

This section contains all the actual rules you must follow in order to stay. They exist because without them we don't get to keep doing this. Witch's Tit accepts no responsibility for your safety or the security of your personal property, but while we are each responsible for our own actions, we also rely on one-another to keep everyone safe. Intervene if you see a potential safety hazard. 

### Community Standards for Safety
**Bring your photo ID.** Your ID will be checked at the gate and is required for admission. Attendees over 21 will be given an Over 21 wristband—not having your wristband on may prevent you from having access to alcohol. Not having a wristband at all may lead to expulsion from the event.

Those under 18 are the responsibility of their parent or legal guardian, **and they must enter the event together.** It is expected that a parent, legal guardian, or an appointed adult will be in charge of the whereabouts, safety, and welfare of minor children at all times.

Drinking alcohol in cold conditions can be very dangerous. Alcohol causes the blood vessels just below your skin's surface to dilate, which creates a false sensation of warmth. This steals heat from your vital organs, decreasing your overall core temperature, while also making you feel warm. Most deaths due to hypothermia involve alcohol, so watch out for yourself and others. **Underage drinking will not be tolerated** and is grounds for removal from the event.

You may choose to explore altered mental states, or encounter others who do. You may offer or be offered opportunities for physical or emotional intimacy, or to take risks. It is your responsibility to know your boundaries, and respect the boundaries of others. It is your responsibility to ask first, clearly and directly, before embarking on any of these adventures with another person, and to respect whatever answer you get. **Minnesota State Law holds that sexual contact with a person who is too intoxicated to consent is third degree sexual assault.** Manipulative behavior, such as begging, cajoling, coercion, retaliation, or abuse directed at someone for saying No are a violation of the safety of our whole community and may get you ejected from the event.

If you experience or encounter an emergency, first and foremost get help! Flag down any person with a radio, such as a Ranger - they can get you a medical response, fire response, or other assistance. If you become a victim of a crime during the event, report it immediately. 

### Rangers & Medical
Rangers are experienced Burners who dedicate some of their time to helping others, and keep an eye on how things are going. Rangers can help mediate disputes, address safety concerns, find resources and information, or even just offer a fresh perspective if someone gets stuck on a problem. Rangers can radio for law enforcement, medical help, firefighting resources if necessary.

You can identify Rangers by the radios they wear, and you are invited to flag one down any time you need help. Rangers are not cops, and talking to a Ranger doesn't mean you are in trouble; they are here to offer support, reflection, and guidance, and then melt away as soon as they are no longer needed.

We have a medical tent with personnel available 24 hours a day during the event. In case of an emergency they can get you help. If you have to call 911, please alert Medical as well. There's a plan in place to get emergency vehicles in and out.

Do you have Medical or Wilderness experience? You would be a huge asset as a [Volunteer](https://witchst.it/volunteer.html).

### Law Enforcement
Witch's Tit is on private land in Pine County, MN. Law enforcement is not expected at the event, but please be respectful if you see a uniformed officer on premises, and alert somebody with a radio. Positive interactions with law enforcement are crucial to the long-term survival of the event. Familiarize yourself with all local, state and federal laws as you would in any municipality.

### Things NOT to bring
- **No Fireworks.** We aren't permitted for explosives and we don't want a visit from the Sheriff.
- **No Firearms.** This includes air rifles, BB guns and pellet guns.
- **No RVs, Trailers, or Campers.** There is no room for these in the parking area.  
That said, there might be room for RVs etc. outside of the parking area, but the rub is that it won't be possible to move them with snow on the ground. If you're coming to the event and want to overwinter your RV on site then [let's talk](mailto:dom@witchst/it).
- **No Pets.**
- **No Glass containers.** We recommend against bringing glass containers, as cleaning up broken glass is very difficult in the snow, and highly problematic in the outdoors in general.
- **Don't use a space heater,** unless you can guarantee that there is no risk of fire, carbon monoxide poisoning or other suffocation/oxygen depletion to yourself or other participants. A carbon monoxide detector is essential and required if you are burning fuel indoors.
- **Bicycles** will not be helpful in our wooded terrain.
- **Mutant Vehicles** require prior coordination with event leads, and may not be possible at all. There is no motor vehicle access inside the event.

### Firewood and Fires
- **Do not bring firewood from outside Pine County.** It is illegal to transport firewood across county lines in Minnesota unless it is MDA certified, heat-treated firewood. Emerald ash borer and spongy moth are spreading because people are moving infested firewood. Protect our trees and [be informed](https://www.mda.state.mn.us/plants-insects/firewood-information).
- **You can pre-order firewood** and it will be ready for you when you arrive. Check the [Event Details](https://witchst.it/event_details.html#wood) page for more info.
- If you prefer to pick up firewood on your way, here's where to go:
  - Victory Gas Station, Exit 191 / 325 Quarry Pl, Sandstone, MN 55072
  - Banning Junction Gas Station, Exit 195 / 60684 MN-23, Finlayson, MN 55735
- **You can purchase firewood at the event,** but it will not be available 24/7. There will be a sign at firewood sales telling you the daily hours and/or when the next shipment is coming in. 
- Your camp is welcome to have your own fire, but **it must be kept off the ground** in a fire ring, barrel or bowl. We will have a place for ashes at the end of the event. 
- **Indoor fire sources** such as wood stoves or propane heats ought to be accompanied by a **fire extinguisher**. Note that some types of fire extinguishers are not suitable for cold-weather use. In general, carbon dioxide, halogenated agents, dry chemical, and dry powder extinguishers work in the cold and water or foam based ones do not. Check the label on yours to find its temperature rating.
- **Put out your fire before bed.**
### Photography
Always ask before taking pictures, get consent of everyone in the image, and please remove any photos if asked.

### (Almost) Nothing is for Sale
There are only two things you can buy at Witch's Tit: firewood and ice. This is a place of sharing and free exchange within a Gift economy. There is no display of commercial logos or banners, or distribution of commercial promotional items in our community. Sales of handmade items and food items are not allowed for any reason. You are invited to give these things away.

## DON'T WRECK THE JOINT
Witch's Tit is a  **Leave No Trace (LNT)** event, which means we leave no physical trace of our activities and where possible, leave a place in a better state than we found it. This presents special challenges in the woods and the snow. There are some things which we are banding together to provide for anyone who needs it. Most Matter out of Place (MOOP) happens a little bit at a time, and it is much easier and more effective to prevent MOOP than to clean it up later. Here are things you can do to contain a mess before you make it.
- **Pre-order Firewood from the event.** Do not bring firewood from home **unless you live in Pine County** (see [Firewood and Fires](https://witchst.it/event_details.html#wood)).
- **Bring camp tables.** If you set things on the ground, they may get lost in the snow.
- **Carry your butts in a tin,** if you smoke. An empty metal candy or mint container works well.
- **Don't walk away from a mess.**
- **Bring trash bags,** you might need more than you expect.
- **Take it home.** Witch's Tit has no community waste disposal (apart from campfire ash, see below). You are responsible for removing everything you bring with you, including all of your trash and recycling, and disposing of them when you get home.
- **If you bring a fire ring,** you can dump your ashes into the Center Camp Fire at the end of the event.
- **Glow sticks are the worst.** Not only are they single-use disposable, they fall off and get left behind. Use battery operated devices instead, preferably rechargeable. 
- Bring gifts that are not likely to be discarded. Don't give away cheap trinkets that become MOOP.
- **Reduce, Reuse, Recycle!** Leave excess packaging at home. Bring a reusable, non-glass drinking vessel when visiting theme camps and installations. Choose recyclable containers and energy efficient light and power sources. Salvage your camp materials and art projects for reuse or adaptation at your next burn event.
- **Do a MOOP sweep** around your art installation, theme camp, and car before leaving. Get the whole camp involved in your sweep. Pick up what you find... if it's yours or not.
- **Portable toilets are for human waste and single-ply toilet paper only.** Dumping trash in the portos is a problem someone is going to have to pay for, and will ruin our relationship with local businesses.
- Did you find something in your MOOP sweep that doesn't belong to you? Leave it in the **Lost and Found**. Check the Lost and Found on your way out, you might find something you didn't know you were missing!

## DON'T JUST SURVIVE

Now that you've made it this far, you might be asking yourself... wait, why are we putting ourselves through all this? That's a good question, and one that every Titterer can only answer for themselves. Ultimately, this Guide is here to help you get through the Survival parts with enough resources left to do something extraordinary in a beautiful, challenging place. 

### Art
There are some experiences we only get to have in isolated, hard to reach places. What would you love to see at Witch's Tit? Well if you don't bring it, who will?

**Lighting up yourself,** your camp, and your art are always important, but even more so in the dark half of the year. We will only get about 10 sunlit hours a day, and 14 hours of darkness. Will your lights last overnight? How will the batteries fare in the cold? 

**Are you interested in bringing a big project** - maybe an effigy to burn, a mutant snow mobile, a semi-permanent structure? We already love the way you think, and want to help! Please fill out the theme camp form linked to on the <a href="https://witchst.it/event_details.html#theme_camp">Event Details</a> page(even if you are by yourself) and we will get you in contact with the right person.

Does your art involve **Flame Effects, Poofers, or Pyrotechnics**? Definitely fill out the theme camp form (even if you are by yourself) to let us know what you have in mind. There are special considerations for flammable materials in extreme cold, and we want to make sure you have access to knowledge and resources particular to your set-up. Make sure you know all relevant laws and regulations, well enough that you can explain them to a law enforcement officer who may not have encountered a fire performance in their jurisdiction before.

### Gifting
Every Gift is unique to the giver, and does not contemplate a return. Gifts don't have to be items of exchange, like tokens in a barter economy. Especially in a Leave No Trace environment, often the best Gifts leave no lasting material at all.

A suggestion: think about which challenge is going to be the hardest struggle for you, personally, living in the snowy woods for a long weekend. Maybe it's that your hands and feet never seem to get warm in the winter. Maybe you feel gross all the time if you don't have a way to wash your hands and face. What if you set your mind to solving that struggle early? And then, what if you found a way to solve it not only for yourself, but for anyone you meet who has the same problem you do?

### Volunteering
Any Burn is only as awesome as its volunteers. There are several things that always need more hands, like Greeting arrivals at the gate, Rangering, and joining the Medical team (especially if you have relevant training or experience). Heck, do you think Witch's Tit could be more awesome if only it had this piece of infrastructure, or that service? We would love it if you got involved. No matter how you give your time, it's a great way to participate, and meet new people! Look for volunteer sign-up details on our [website](https://witchst.it/volunteer.html).

## DON'T FORGET YOUR STUFF

This section is a sample checklist for itemized prep. It isn't exhaustive, but it should be a solid start for anyone who wants to use it.

### Before The Event
- Have you [ordered your Firewood](https://witchst.it/event_details.html#wood)?
- Have you tested your winter camping gear?
- Have you checked the [weather report](https://weather.com/weather/tenday/l/8b0d9cfc5fc2b22ff8ea379005d80ea0a2dcd6b5d2f666a7e613efdce82b8761)?
### Clothing Checklist
- **Under shirts**: Synthetic if you have them, extras if you don't. Baselayer style undershirts are good, but don't set yourself up to have to take off your inner layer if you get too hot.
- **Sweatshirt**: Cotton is ok if you can keep it dry, away from your skin and away from the elements, If it gets wet it will be of no use.
- **Long johns**: Again layers are good, but don't set yourself up to have to take off your inner layer if you get too hot.
- **Hat**: (One that fits in a pocket is nice so you can easily control your temperature. A thicker one is nice too if it is really cold.)
- **Thin gloves**: You can fit in your jacket pockets to help control your temperature.
- **Thick gloves**: And/or thick mittens you can fit thin gloves in.
- **Scarf**: Balaclava or Neck Gaiter. Something to go around your neck.
- **Pants**: You could find a better burn to commit to all weekend shirtcocking. 
- **Insulated Snow Pants**: And/or a water resistant layer over pants.
- **Socks**: Tall socks that go above your boots, wool socks. Extra socks. Dry socks are key.
- **Insulated, waterproof boots**: These are a must ­have!. 
- **Alt shoes**: If you have a second pair of boots, great, if not bring extra gear to wear while you dry out your boots because they will get wet. 
- **Winter Jacket**: Make sure you open or take off your jacket if you get warm. Moisture is your enemy in the cold. 
- **Pjs**: Some dedicated clothing to wear only when sleeping that will stay dry is a good idea. Or, some people sleep in the next day's base layer. 
### Camp Gear Checklist
- **Ground pad**: Sleeping pad/cot - The more the better. Add a yoga mat or rug or couch cushions or anything to keep you off the ground. If it is warm you don't want to melt the snow below you, if it is cold you want good insulation from it. 
- **Sleeping bag**: If your sleeping bag is not rated for how cold it will be +10 or so, add a blanket inside and or outside, or put your sleeping bag inside another. Don't put your head in your sleeping bag, or you will end up with a wet sleeping bag. Consider wearing a hat to bed.
- **Headlamp**, flashlight, tent light, costume lights (Sunset is a little after 5:00pm in February)
- **Spare battery(s)** for headlamp and other electronics.
- **First Aid kit.**
- **Garbage bags**, Witch's Tit is a leave no trace event and garbage cans/dumpsters will not be available at the event.
- Required **Medications** and Health and Beauty Aids, including prescriptions, 
- If you wear **contacts** and take them out at night, you might want to keep them in your sleeping bag so they are warm and not frozen in the morning.
- **A cup** you can carry. Some camps may offer food or drink, but you are generally expected to have your own container. 
- A **camp chair** 
- **Spare key** If you have a spare key to your vehicle you should bring it.
- **Hand warmers** (you can also stick these in your boots at night to dry them out if they get wet.)  
- **Tent** - A winter tent is awesome, but any tent with good ventilation so you don't get frost on the inside. (your breath will freeze) You could probably get away with a tarp system as there are no bugs. 
- **Water Bottle**: with a good seal, if you put a bottle of warm water inside your sleeping bag before you go to bed it will warm up the bag and if you leave it in the sleeping bag overnight you will have water that is not frozen in the morning.
- **Plastic sled** we will help you bring your gear to center camp, but from there it is on you.
- **Sunscreen**: You get sun + reflected sun off the snow.
- **Lotion/lip balm:** Cold weather can be tough on your skin, and chapped lips are no fun.
- **Earplugs**: Not everyone will want to sleep when you do.
- **Cooking Stuff** See above for a short list of things you may want to bring. 
- **CO Detector & Fire Extinguisher** depending on your approach to combustion.
- **Food and Water**
